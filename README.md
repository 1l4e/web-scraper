# web-scraper
This repository contains a simple web scraper built with SvelteKit for educational purposes. It demonstrates the use of SvelteKit, Axios for making HTTP requests, and Svelte Sonner for displaying toast messages. The project is intended for learning and exploring web scraping concepts using SvelteKit.

# why SvelteKit
This site uses Svelte and SvelteKit to display scraped data as a movie site. Due to some older TV web browsers lacking support for JavaScript, it is necessary to have SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to display videos on those devices..
